I have developed an interest in having a supporting role to help build products rather than building the product myself. My extensive background in QA has given me a perspective on the importance of building quality into the product every step of the way, and I wanted to integrate that from a project management standpoint. I care about being able to help in projects every step of the way, so I think pivoting to a project management role is the best for my career goals.
